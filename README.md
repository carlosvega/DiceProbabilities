**The problem statement is:**

> Given a certain number d of dices and a number n of throws, write a function that plots the distribution of the sum of the dices (i.e. an histogram of how many times a particular sum occurs).

The solution is based on the two following articles, in which they use the solution shown in the book *Introduction To Mathematical Probability*[1](https://github.com/carlosvega/DiceProbabilities/raw/master/docs/Uspensky.pdf)[2](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.263184) by [James Victor Uspensky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._V._Uspensky) in pages 14 to 26 with formula depicted in page 24.
